For post processing:
1. Add Post-process Layer to camera 
2. Add Post-process Volume to camera
3. Add /Effects/PostProcessingProfile to Profile in Post-process Volume



URP note: 
You can convert materials to URP by Menu Edit->Rednder Pipeline->Universal Render Pipeline->Upgrade Project Materials. But vertical green fog shader and fire particles will not work correctly.
